# TripleTen_8---Y.Afisha_Business_Analysis

## Business Analysis

Fernando Soares Goudard

The task is to help a company optimize its marketing expenses. We received server logs with data on visits to Y.Afisha from January 2017 to December 2018, a dump file with all orders placed during this period, and marketing expense statistics.

The following will be analyzed:

    How people use the product
    When they start buying
    How much money each customer brings to the company
    When expenses will be covered

Reports and metrics calculations will be made:

Product

    How many people use it each day, week, and month?
    How many sessions occur per day? (A user can have multiple sessions.)
    How long is each session?
    How often do users return?

Sales

    When do people start buying?
    How many orders do customers place during a given period of time?
    What is the average purchase volume?
    How much money do they bring to the company (LTV)?

Marketing

    How much money was spent? In total/by source/over time
    How much did customer acquisition cost for each source?
    Were the investments worthwhile? (ROI)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, user retention is low, with only 3.91% of users returning to purchase in the following month. This indicates that there is an opportunity for improvement in customer retention and loyalty. Sales retention is half that of session retention. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and optimize the user journey to improve the sales conversion rate. It is important to investigate why half of users are not completing their purchases.

Average revenue per sale and per user shows seasonal variations, with peaks in December. Older cohorts have a higher LTV than newer cohorts, indicating that the quality of recently acquired users is lower in terms of revenue generation over time. It is essential to find ways to increase the LTV of newer cohorts. One way is to increase retention so that LTV increases more quickly.

Source 3 has the highest total marketing cost, lowest return per CAC, and lowest total revenue. It is recommended to discontinue spending on this source. The best sources to invest in are sources 1 and 2, due to their high return per CAC and higher total revenues. Source 5 is also interesting due to its lower CAC and higher number of users attracted. The change in marketing spending should increase LTV, as users from sources 1 and 2 spend more.

There is a cycle of cohorts with good returns alternating with cohorts with poor returns. The September 2017 cohort achieved an excellent return, while subsequent cohorts had less satisfactory returns. It is important to seek to improve retention and identify why there are differences in cohort quality in order to reduce the time needed to achieve a return on investment.

Therefore, it is recommended to focus spending on sources 1, 2, and 5 for future investments and cut marketing expenses in the first months of the year, as they are not resulting in increased revenue per sale. It is recommended to allocate these resources to the last months of the year, which have the highest revenue per sale and per user.

In addition, September 2017, which had abnormally high LTV and ROMI, should be investigated to identify the cause and replication. It is important to focus on improving user retention, increasing conversion rates, and seeking strategies to increase the LTV of the most recent cohorts.
